## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Little preview layout, plenty of details in the hover states and svg.

### Continued development

Having trouble getting the background of svg container to show, resulting in bad hover state for mobile. Tried for a fully responsive layout for mobile and tablet but the share button was tricky. Would have to rethink the whole process.
